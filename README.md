# stud

My learning stuffs about programming. Also its include my personel notes, docs, experience about computer science, math and coding.

# Before Start

its simply my local study code folder/repo into the internet.

## incomplete

**right now i more interest about upload my code instead of focusing getting started doc or readme documentation vice versa. so if you found this readme little bit of confusing or detect any of misinformation. its ok. this doc not completed yet.**

## license

i have know nothing about any of licence. so if something is wrong please notify me. but i believe any reachable materials from the internet can be use any of from anyone. those concepts also differ from country by country or regions. so when i was a kid this didnt teached to me from any school which i graduated.

hello, im `baus`. this repo kinda docs or intro for programming experience what im currently interest about computer science and what i studied, searched or coded since when i start learning programing.

Some of those topics are my most loving programming languages, terminal, the internet, general concepts of computing in compsci, math, data science, web development, python development, game development, C/C++, ios app development etcâ€¦

also this is not a showcase of my portfolio, or complete beginner friendly tutorial for who want to learn coding.

im selfthaught programmer. Has no mentor, These are my searching results, tutorials and docs reached by me from all around the internet when i decided to learn coding. i never created or publish all subcontent on this repo. these are mostly free internet resources whose their creator published this for a some reason.
